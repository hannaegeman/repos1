              <p>Stampen Media, like many other media companies, is facing a significant
                transformation in paper newspaper distribution, necessitating an
                alternative solution. Our primary focus is on increasing the adoption of
                the existing digital platform. The target audience primarily consists of
                the older generation, making the transition from print to digital a
                considerable challenge. This shift not only impacts readers and their
                trust in Stampen Media's publications but also results in a decline in
                paying subscribers.</p>

            </article>
            <article class="col-md-8">
                <p>My project and research were aimed at laying the groundwork for
                  enhancing the user-friendliness and accessibility of the current
                  digital product. The objective was to improve the overall user
                  experience and cater to the existing needs as effectively as possible.
                  The semi-structured interviews were conducted during two events
                  organized by the marketing and customer service teams. These events
                  aimed to assist and support users who felt uncertain about the digital
                  transformation. Engaging directly with readers affected by
                  digitalization and reduced distribution yielded numerous advantages.
                  The user tests were born out of the insights gained from the
                  interviews, serving as an extension and deepening of the collected
                  data. These tests were conducted during the Book Fair in one of the
                  company's titles, G√∂teborgs-Posten's booth.</p>

              <article class="col-md-8">
                  <p>Both the interviews and user tests were carried out using a variant of
                    "guerilla usability testing," which involves approaching test
                    participants in public settings and asking if they would like to take
                    part in the study. This method is cost-effective and time-efficient.
                    For this study, we limited the "public setting" by conducting it at
                    Digi-Vad and Bokm√§ssan, allowing us to have a more target-specific
                    test group.</p>

                <p>Data from both parts of the research were analyzed using thematic
                  analysis. Thematic analysis is used to analyze qualitative data in a
                  way that allows the identification, analysis, and description of
                  themes. As a result of this project, I was able to propose six
                  concrete suggestions for improvement moving forward.</p>

        <p> My key takeaways from this project are that continuous iteration is
          crucial. It's essential to remain receptive and humble in one's work
          while also having a clear direction. As a UX designer, one must listen
          and understand. To do so effectively, it's important to involve others
          in one's work.</p>
